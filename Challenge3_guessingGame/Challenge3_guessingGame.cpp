// Challenge3_guessingGame.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.

//The computer generates a random number between 0 and 100. The user then has a certain number of guesses to guess the number.If the user guesses correctly, they win.If the user runs out of guesses, they lose.
//
//The user will be prompted to enter a difficulty level to determine the number of guesses they get(easy: 10, medium : 6, hard : 3, extreme : 1).
//The computer will generate a random number between 0 and 100 (hidden from the user!).
//The user will be prompted to enter a guess.
//If the user's guess is incorrect, they will be hinted to guess higher or lower and their guess counter will go down by 1. Go back to step 3.
//If the user's guess is correct, they win. Go back to step 1
